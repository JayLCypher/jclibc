# jclibc - Opinionated C STL

Just a re-implementation of some C standard library functions for fun. Bits and bobs written or found from places, comments will denote from where if applicable.
No license yet.

## I swear I'm right
Because if I'm not right, I'm wrong. And I don't like that.




## Components

* String_View (Which is just a fat pointer, sue me.)
* Argc and Argv stack manipulation
* C String manipulation
* Memory block manipulation
